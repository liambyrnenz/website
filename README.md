# website

My new personal website, written in React and employing a pretty neat and simplistic custom tile system. [Check it out here!](https://liambyrne.nz)

I designed and developed this website from scratch using `create-react-app`, taking inspiration from websites like the official NZ Top 40 website (https://nztop40.co.nz) and tweaking it to appear more like a mobile user interface.

This is technically the second version of my website: it has been completely overhauled since the start of 2019 but the original website can still be found in the history of this repository.
